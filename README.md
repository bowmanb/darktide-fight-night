# Asheron's Call - Darktide Fight Night

This project preserves a Flash artifact from the **Asheron's Call** MMORPG, specifically from the **Darktide** PvP server.

## About

**Darktide** was a unique server in Asheron's Call where Player vs Player (PvP) combat was enabled almost everywhere. The community was known for its intense rivalries, politics, and "Fight Night" events where players gathered to battle.

This repository hosts `fightnight.swf`, a Flash animation/recording related to these events, preserved playable in a modern browser using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).
