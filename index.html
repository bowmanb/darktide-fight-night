        <h1>Asheron's Call - Darktide Fight Night</h1>
        <p>
            This Flash file is a preserved artifact from the community of <strong>Asheron's Call</strong>, specifically
            the <strong>Darktide</strong> server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Darktide was unique among Asheron's Call servers as a dedicated PvP (Player vs Player) environment. Unlike
            the PvE servers, Darktide allowed players to attack each other almost anywhere in the game world, with full
            loot drop mechanics upon death. This created a harsh, competitive, and highly political atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Fight Nights" were often community-organized events where players and guilds (allegiances) would gather to
            settle scores, hold tournaments, or simply engage in chaotic free-for-all combat. These events were a staple
            of the server's culture, often recorded and shared by players.
